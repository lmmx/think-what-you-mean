# Think What You Mean

Fork of the [_Say What You Mean_](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/demos/blob/main/say-what-you-mean/)
demos to reproduce the results with r1!

The original demo was a rebuttal to a claim that structured generation reduced performance, the
notebooks here benchmark the performance on tasks like GSM8K with Chain of Thought (CoT) and structured generation.
